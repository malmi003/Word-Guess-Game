# Word-Guess-Game

## Objective
Similar to other hangperson games, the objective of this game is to guess the correct term, one letter at a time, before your number of guesses runs out.

## How to play
Select any key to begin. Then begin guessing lowercase letters a-z by selecting them with your keyboard. Each time you guess a letter correctly, the term will fill itself in with that letter. Guess all the letters before your number of guesses run out to win the game.
